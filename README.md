# üçÖ Pomo CLI

A simple command-line Pomodoro timer. 


## Description

This is a CLI tool to help you manage your time using the Pomodoro Technique. You can start timers for specific tasks, view your task history, and stop running timers.

## Installation

To use this tool, you need to have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone or download the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arushdesp/pomo-cli
    cd pomo-cli
    ```

2.  **Build the executable:**
    ```bash
    go build -o pomo-cli pomo-cli.go
    ```
    This will create an executable file named `pomo-cli` for your current OS.

    To specifically create a Windows executable (`.exe`) from a non-Windows OS, use the following command:
    ```bash
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o pomo-cli.exe
    ```

### Adding to PATH for Easy Usage

To use `pomo-cli` from any directory, you should move the executable to a directory that is in your system's PATH.

#### macOS and Linux

1.  **Move the executable:**
    ```bash
    sudo mv pomo-cli /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    This moves the executable to a common directory for user-installed executables.

2.  **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pomo-cli
    ```

Now you can run the tool by simply typing `pomo-cli` in your terminal.

### Windows TO CHECK after making the .exe ( TO-DO )
